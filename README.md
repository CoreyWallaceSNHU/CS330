**How do I approach designing software?**

Since I had never used OpenGL before and had no prior knowledge of creating 3D programs, I essentially created each feature one at a time. I tested a feature after it was put into use and then finished any last-minute adjustments. Every week, the features were determined by the requirements. 

**How do I approach developing programs?**

We were required to complete portions of the project as milestone targets in addition to weekly responsibilities. This made it easier to build software using an agile, iterative process. Adding lighting to the scene was a subsequent milestone. As a result, an iterative development cycle allowed the milestones to flow organically. I outlined the requirements, programmed, tested, and polished the final implementation at each milestone. 

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

This experience alone has given me new abilities because I had very little expertise with OpenGL and building 3D applications. Technically speaking, this project was still technically complex and required the capacity to plan and solve challenges. My ability to solve problems and be technically proficient has therefore increased.
